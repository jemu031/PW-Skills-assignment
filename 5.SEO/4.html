          One building looks like it is flipping you the bird, and another looks
          like a long tree

        <h3>Albany</h3>
        <p>
          When we arrived in North America, we felt that it was a good idea to
          break the journey from New York to Canada into two and squeeze in some
          sightseeing on the way. Albany is strategically located en route to
          Montreal and also felt like it could be an interesting enough place to
          spend a day in.
        </p>
        <h3>Buffalo</h3>
        <p>
          We have decided to mention our visit to Buffalo here as well, even
          though it chronologically is slightly misplaced. There isn't much to
          say to be honest. We arrived in the late afternoon and we left in the
          morning the day after so we barely saw anything. The only thing worth
          mentioning really is the colossal city hall. The city hall is built in
          the style Art Deco and it is really massive. But the design is a bit
          flawed if you ask us. When seen from street level the building
          resembles a short, thick, erect male reproduction organ surrounded by
          an unusually large tuft of pubic hair. Well, it does! Look at the
          photo we uploaded and you'll probably agree.
