          Discover great typography and iconography Our font catalog places
          typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and test
          fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type
          designers and foundries, giving you valuable information about the
          typographers and their process, as well as analytics on usage and
          demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you discover
          new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
          designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort
          organizes fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic
          location. You can also create your own highly customized collections
          by filtering families, weights, and scripts, plus test color themes,
          and review sample copy. Collections can be shared, making it easy to
          collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized and
          streamlined throughout the design and engineering process. In 2021, we
          added icons to our Google Fonts catalog, expanding expressive
          capability for our users. Our first set was the Material
          icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common communication
          needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital products
          for Android, iOS, and web. Choose and use type with purpose Google
          Fonts Knowledge supplements our font catalog with a rich library of
          peer-reviewed guides to the world of typography, created by
          typographic experts around the world. It covers universal principles
          of typography for any medium, with scope to delve into all of the
          artistic and technical aspects of modern typesetting and font
          technology. Collaborate with open source All the fonts and icons in
          our catalog are open source and available to anyone, making beautiful
          typography and iconography accessible to anyone for any project. This
          means you can share favorites and collaborate easily with friends and
          colleagues. Google Fonts takes care of all the licensing and hosting,
          ensuring that the latest and greatest version of any font is available
          to everyone. Make the web faster Using the code generated by Google
          Fonts, our servers will automatically send the smallest possible file
          to every user based on the technologies that their browser supports.
          For example, we use WOFF 2.0 compression when available. This makes
          the web faster for all users—particularly in areas where bandwidth and
          connectivity are an issue. The icon sets that are delivered by Google
          Fonts benefit from the same infrastructure. Now everyone can enjoy the
          same quality and design integrity in their products and web pages, no
          matter where they are in the world.
