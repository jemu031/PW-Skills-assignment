      Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking
      and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are
      software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over
      time. As development environments have accelerated, version control
      systems help software teams work faster and smarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in
      a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back
      the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake
      while minimizing disruption to all team members.

    <h1>key benifits of version control system</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Facilitates Collaboration:</strong>Enables multiple developers
        to work concurrently on a project without conflicts, fostering
        collaboration and speeding up development. Ensures
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Code Integrity:</strong> Protects the stability of the codebase
        by allowing developers to revert to previous versions in case of issues
        or bugs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supports Agile Development:</strong> Accommodates iterative and
        incremental development methodologies by allowing developers to work on
        specific features independently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improves Code Quality:</strong> Facilitates code reviews,
        leading to better code quality as developers can catch and address
        issues early in the development process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Simplifies Debugging:</strong> The ability to trace changes
        helps in identifying when and why a particular issue was introduced,
        making debugging more efficient.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Enables Experimentation:</strong> Developers can create
        branches to experiment with new ideas or features without affecting the
        stability of the main codebase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Provides Disaster Recovery:</strong> Acts as a safeguard
        against data loss by serving as a backup, allowing the project to be
        restored to a previous state in case of emergencies.
