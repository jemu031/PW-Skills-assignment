      Git is a distributed version control system that employs a specific
      workflow involving the working directory, staging area, and repository.
      The <strong>working directory</strong> is where developers modify files,
      and it represents the current state of the project. Changes made in the
      working directory are tracked by Git.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>staging area</strong> acts as an intermediary step before
      committing changes to the repository. Developers use the "git add" command
      to move specific changes from the working directory to the staging area.
      This allows for selective inclusion of modifications in the upcoming
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>repository</strong> is where Git permanently stores project
      history. It consists of committed changes from the staging area.
      Developers use the "git commit" command to save changes to the repository,
      creating a snapshot of the project at that moment. The repository also
      maintains branches, enabling parallel lines of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the Git workflow involves making changes in the working
      directory, selectively staging them in the staging area, and finally
      committing them to the repository, creating a versioned history of the
      project. This structured approach provides flexibility and control over
      project development, collaboration, and version management.
