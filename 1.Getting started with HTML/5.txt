DOCTYPE declaration 
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
<!DOCTYPE html>

Older HTML Documents
In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration were more complicated. Some of the documents were HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1 etc
The declarations looks like this,
HTML 4.01:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
XHTML 1.1:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
