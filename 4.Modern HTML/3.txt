Accessibility
It involves creating content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Key practices include: 
	- providing alternative text for images,
	- keyboard accessibility, clear navigation, and 
	- adherence to standards like Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

The principle is that everyone should be able to use the web equally, regardless of any disability, is as important today as it was twenty years ago. People who have limited use of their arms, people who cannot hear or see well and people who process information differently, should all be able to access and use web sites and apps. 
Web technologies have many built in features for accessibility, and we as web developers should know them so that we do not exclude any of our users.
